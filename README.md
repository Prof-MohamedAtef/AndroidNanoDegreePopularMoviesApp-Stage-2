Popular Movies for stage one

android App tries to fetch most popular and top rated movies with its details

Dear reveiwer, 
you will not find the API_KEY for my third party, just try to exchange it with your own.
Just open MainFragment.java file, then you will find API_KEY as a hidden var, change it and start debugging.

Thanks
