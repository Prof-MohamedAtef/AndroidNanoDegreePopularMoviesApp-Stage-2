2nd and 3rd projects in Nanodegree for android program - Stage one + Two in Popular Movies App

Popular Movies for stage one + Two

android App tries to fetch most popular and top rated movies with its details

I have used Android Architecture Components, specially ViewModel and Live Data in Room Persistence Library.
I have Implemented Insert and Update Opertions using AsyncTask.

Dear reveiwer, 
you will not find the API_KEY for my third party, just try to exchange it with your own.
Just open MainFragment.java file, then you will find API_KEY as a hidden var, change it and start debugging.

Thanks
